    Exercise5)

    Implement a function called 'drawNumDiamond' taking a parameter int called h,
    returning void ('void drawDiamond(int h)')
    This function should print a diamond like this, where h is the 'height' of the diamond, so for e.g. h=9:
        1
       222
      33333
     4444444
    555555555
     4444444
      33333
       222
        1
    You are going to need odd numbers to do this, so just print 'No valid input!' if an even number or a number smaller
     than 0 is given. In case of 0 just leave the function right away without printing anything.
     Try to use a maximum 3 for-loops for this exercise (you do not have to use recursion in this one) and it should
     be possible to call the function with any h <= 17

     please make sure to call the method exactly as given ('drawDiamond(int h)') otherwise the tests will fail
