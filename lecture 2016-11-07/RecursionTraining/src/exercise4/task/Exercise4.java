/**
 * Exercise4) recursion with Strings
 *
 * implement a function called 'drawDots' taking an int a parameter and returning a String
 *
 * this function should print the number followed by the same number of '.' if the number is positive,
 * if the number is negative only the '.' are printed
 * if the number equals 0 just return ""
 * e.g. drawDots(4) should return a String equal to: "4...."
 *      drawDots(-4) should return a String equal to: "...."
 *      drawDots(1) should return a String equal to: "1."
 *      drawDots(-1) should return a String equal to: "."
 *      drawDots(0) should return a String equal to: ""
 *      etc.
 *
 * do not use loops in your implementation
